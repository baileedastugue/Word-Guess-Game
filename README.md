This project takes in the user's keyboard input and checks to see if that letter exists in the randomly picked word. If the letter is in that word, the correctly guessed letter appears along the underscores at the top of the page. If the letter is not in that word, that letter is displayed and one of the user's lives is lost. If the user correctly guesses all the letters in the word, the user is alerted of their win and the correctly guessed word is displayed below. If the user uses up all their lives with incorrect guesses, they are alerted of their loss. Whether the user wins or loses, they are given the option to play the game again.

This project is useful because it applies basic javascript functionality and illustrates how javascript can be used to change the DOM of a webpage.
